# Live Score Display App

This live score display app is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and
showcases real-time sports game scores.

## Developer's note

This is my first time using React for a project from scratch, so there's bound to be mistakes. Likely there are
dependencies installed that aren't even used in the project.

## Quick Start

This project uses Yarn as its package manager. Here's how to get it running:

### `yarn start`

Starts the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The app will reload if you edit and save your files.

### `yarn test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode. See more about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing it for best performance. The output is minified and
filenames include hashes. Your app is then ready for deployment. Learn more about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn eject`

**Caution: irreversible operation.** Use `eject` to customize build tool and configuration choices. This command copies
all config files and dependencies directly into your project, so you have full control. Note: Once you `eject`, there's
no going back!

If you donâ€™t want to eject, that's okay! The setup is intended for small to midsize deployments, and you can make many
customizations within the limitations of Create React App.
